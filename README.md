# Web Voice Assistant

This is a starter template for [LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents) that provides a simple voice interface using the [LiveKit JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js). It supports [voice](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai), [transcriptions](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/text/), and [virtual avatars](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/avatar).

This template is built with Next.js and is free for you to use or modify as you see fit.

## Getting started

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to try this application without modification, you can deploy an instance in just a few clicks with [LiveKit Cloud Sandbox](https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/p_/sandbox/templates/voice-assistant-frontend).

Run the following command to automatically clone this template.

```bash
lk app create --template voice-assistant-frontend
```

Then run the app with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

And open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You'll also need an agent to speak with. Try our [Voice AI Quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/start/voice-ai) for the easiest way to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to modify the LiveKit project credentials used, you can edit `.env.local` (copy from `.env.example` if you don't have one) to suit your needs.
